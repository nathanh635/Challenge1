# Code Refactor Starter Code

The objective of the project was to refactor the existing Horiseon code to make it more accessible and user friendly.

I made the following changes:

-changed div in line 11 and 26 to header

-changed div in line 13 and 25 to nav

-changed div in lines 28 and 50 to main

-changed "div"s within new main to sections

-changed div on lines 51 and 74 to aside

-changed divs within aside to sections

-changed line 27 div (hero class) to figure since it's an image

-changed lines 75 and 81 from div class footer to footer element.

-changed the CSS style sheet to match the updated identifiers.

-corrected the link for "search engine optimization" as it was missing the ID tag in the main

-added alt tags to images and icons

-changed the webpage title to be more representative of the content.

-reordered CSS items based on the part of the document they were in (header, main, aside, etc.)

Based on the CSS file, there are several spots where it would be possible to shorten the style sheet as well. I.e., grouping the benefit images, which all have the same class attributes, together. But based on my understanding of the assignment, we're supposed to leave those in case they need to be individually modified.
